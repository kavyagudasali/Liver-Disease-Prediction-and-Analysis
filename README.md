<h1>Liver Disease Prediction and Analysis</h1>

This project focuses on predicting liver diseases using a dataset containing liver patient records. The tasks involve data analysis, model implementation, and an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the model's design.

## Project Structure

### Task 1: Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Prepare a comprehensive data analysis report on the liver disease dataset.
- **Description:** This section provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) that examines the distribution of patient demographics, liver function test results, and other relevant features. It aims to identify patterns and correlations that could impact disease prediction.

### Task 2: Predictive Modeling
- **Objective:** Develop predictive models using various classifiers to forecast the likelihood of liver disease.
- **Description:** Multiple classifiers are implemented and evaluated to predict liver disease, with a focus on comparing their performance. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests may be explored.

### Task 3: Model Design Analysis
- **Objective:** Provide a detailed analysis of the model design choices.
- **Description:** This section explains the rationale behind the selection of features, classifiers, and preprocessing steps. The analysis justifies the decisions made during the model-building process, ensuring the model's robustness and accuracy.

### Model Comparison Report
- **Description:** A report comparing the performance of different classifiers, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The report suggests the most suitable model for production deployment.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Description:** A report detailing the challenges encountered during data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning, along with the techniques employed to address these issues.

## Dataset
The dataset contains records of liver patients and non-liver patients, including various liver function test results and demographic information.
